# GourceNameFixes
A collection of text files used by my Gource automation script for correcting and unifying git usernames.

Each txt file is a collection of regular expressions or alternate names, each on a separate line.
Do note that they are evaluated in order from first to last.

missing_names.txt is a list of names that do not have a correction and cannot be found as GitHub users.
